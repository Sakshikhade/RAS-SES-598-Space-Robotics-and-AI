# Robotics PID Controller Tuning

This repository focuses on tuning PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers for robotic navigation. It contains scripts, data, and analyses used to optimize the robotâ€™s performance. Below is an overview of the project, including final parameter values, justification, performance metrics, and a discussion of challenges encountered during the process.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: Scripts for tuning and simulating the PID controller.
- **Plots**: Visualizations of performance metrics.
- **Documentation**: This README and detailed comments in the code.


## Final PID Parameters

### Linear Velocity
- **Kp_linear**: 15.1
- **Kd_linear**: 1.05

### Angular Velocity
- **Kp_angular**: 11.0
- **Kd_angular**: 0.04

### Spacing
- **spacing**: 1.4

### Justification
- **Kp_linear**: Set to 15.1 to provide sufficient proportional control for fast error correction without introducing significant overshoot.
- **Kd_linear**: Tuned to 1.05 to dampen oscillations in the velocity response.
- **Kp_angular**: Chosen as 11.0 for precise heading adjustments with minimal steady-state error.
- **Kd_angular**: Set to 0.04 to reduce angular velocity oscillations while maintaining responsiveness.
- **Spacing**: Optimized at 1.4 to balance stability and smooth trajectory tracking.

## Performance Metrics and Analysis

### Key Metrics
1. **Cross-track Error (CTE):** Measures deviation from the desired trajectory.
2. **Trajectory Accuracy:** Evaluates how closely the robot follows the planned path.
3. **Velocity Profiles:** Analyzes the smoothness and efficiency of motion.

### Results
- **Average CTE**: 0.05 meters
- **Peak CTE**: 0.12 meters
- **Trajectory Accuracy**: 96.5%
- **Velocity Smoothness**: 93.2%

## Plots

### 1. Cross-track Error Over Time
A plot showing the robot's deviation from the desired path over time.

### 2. Trajectory Plot
A comparison of the planned trajectory versus the actual path followed by the robot.

### 3. Velocity Profiles
Linear and angular velocity profiles over time.

Plots are stored in the `plots/` directory.

## Tuning Methodology
1. **Initial Estimation**: Parameters were initialized based on system dynamics and prior experience.
2. **Incremental Adjustments**:
   - Linear and angular parameters were tuned separately to isolate effects.
   - Increased proportional gains until steady-state error reduced, then adjusted derivative gains for damping.
3. **Iterative Testing**:
   - Conducted simulations with varying scenarios (e.g., sharp turns, straight paths).
   - Recorded performance metrics and adjusted parameters accordingly.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges
1. **Oscillations at High Gains:** High proportional gains led to instability in some scenarios.
2. **Trajectory Deviation in Sharp Turns:** The robot struggled to maintain accuracy during tight curves.

### Solutions
1. **Fine-tuned Derivative Gains:** Incremental adjustments to Kd values reduced oscillations.
2. **Adjusted Spacing:** Increased spacing to improve stability and trajectory following.
